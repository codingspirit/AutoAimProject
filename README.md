# AutoAimProject
This is an unfinished Auto Aim Project(actually I use camshfit to do that) based on C# and emgucv, 
with a android app writen by java to manual control.motor controler is stm32f407. I'm trying to solve the PID control part,
I used a sucked camera, at dark place it only capture 10 frames per sec. I really should change that. sad.
Folder AutoAimProject based on c#
Folder AutoAimProject_MCU based on C
Folder MOS_H is PCB design file
